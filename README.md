# Game of Life - React Implementation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project structure

This project was built to demonstrate core concepts of React using a simple, three pseudo-layer architecture:

- **Service**: It's built to act as a stateless API, all Game of Life logic is here
- **Context**: Orchestrates the state of the game, including store management.
- **UI**: Provides visible feedback and handles user input.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
